# BikeSharing: NYC Citi Bikes with Tableau and Python
[Bikesharing Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/manasvi1348/viz/bikesharing_16429716477380/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis)
## Overview
Inspired by a recent trip to NYC, Kate and I have an idea to start a bikesharing business for our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. After brainstorming for a few weeks, Kate had found a potential angel investor who could be interested in providing funding to explore a bikeshare in Des Moines. As amazing as this is, the mechanics of making a business like this work in Des Moines will be quite different than NYC. We studied how the bikeshare business actually works in NYC and created a proposal on how it may work in Des Moines.

In order to convince our investors, we will be creating a bike trip analysis using Pandas to show the length of time bikes are checked out for riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. We added these visualizations to our final presentation.

## Summary
Based off our analysis, we can infer that many of CitiBike's users may not be tourists, but rather are work commuters (based on the peak times being around morning and evening commute). In addition, majority of the users are male riders. This information will be helpful in future marketing campagins. A significant discovery is that most of the bikeshare time durations are around 5 minutes (possibly due to stations being close together). If a similar bikesharing program were to be set up in Des Moines, it would be beneficial if the bike stations would be set up within 10 minutes of biking distance from each other. NYC is a large city with many work commuters, residents, and tourists going around some blocks which makes it reasonable to have more stations near each other while Des Moines is mostly subarbs and spread out. We will also need more detail on the amount of bike-enthusiast commuters, locals, and tourists Des Moines has to understand if a bikesharing program will be profitable there.

With the data we currently have, I propose to create a visualization in which we observe rides by age. This would also be important for future marketing campaigns to know which age range they should prioritize. I would also like a visualization for trip starting and ending locations during the morning and evening rush hours to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods.
